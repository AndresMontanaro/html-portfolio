        <h3>The Family Plan</h3>
            <h4>It has 2.5 stars</h4>
            <p>The baby is a major part of the first big action sequence, a fight<br />
                in a grocery store in which Dan has to fend off an assassin while<br />
                the little one is in a carrier strapped to his chest. If this sounds<br />
                ridiculous, you’re not wrong. It’s the first indication that “The<br />
                Family Plan” is really going to go nowhere, relying on<br />
                impossible situations for comedy instead of anything grounded<br />
                or relatable. The charm of the best of this subgenre comes from<br />
                familiarity working its way through both the action and the<br />
                comedy. “The Family Plan” constantly lacks a foundation of<br />
                recognizable human behavior and doesn’t replace its<br />
                unbelievability with laughs or thrills.<br />

        <h3>Wanka</h3>
            <h4>It has 3 stars</h4>
            <p>"Candy doesn't have to have a point. That's why it's candy."</p>
        <h3>Finestkind</h3>
            <h4>It has 2 stars</h4>
            <p>Like its main characters, this movie is at its best on the sea. This film’s location, the fishing community of New Bedford, Massachusetts, is where writer/director Brian Helgeland, grew up, and like its characters, he worked on a boat that collected deep sea scallops over 100 miles offshore for two weeks at a time. 
            </p>
        <h3>The Taste of Things</h3>
            <h4>It has 3.5 stars</h4>
            <p>In "The Taste of Things," no distinction is made between cooking for someone and loving them. It's "all one". </p>
